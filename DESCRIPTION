Description: Make R scripts that rely on CRAN, GitHub & Gitlab packages reproducible, 
	by ensuring that every time a given script is run, the same version of the originally used 
	packages and dependencies are loaded, regardless of where (which computer) and when the script is run. 
	In contrast with the default behavior by R, which is to rely on whichever version of package the 
	user running the script happens to have installed. 
	Version control is achieved with the new command 'groundhog.library()', which replaced the base command 
	'library()'. The date determines which version of the package is installed. For CRAN packages groundhog 
	loads (and installs if needed) the the most advanced version of the package (and all its dependencies) 
	available on CRAN on that date.	
	For GitHub and Gitlab packages, groundhog loads the package including only commits written up to that date.
