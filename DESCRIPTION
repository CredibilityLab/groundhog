Description: grounghogR seeks to make R scripts that rely on packages
    reproducible by ensuring that every time a given script is run, the same
    version of the used pacakges are loaded (instead of whichever version the
    user running the script happens to have installed). This is achieved by
    using the new command groundhog.library() instead of the base command
    library(), and including a date in the call. The date is used to call on
    the same version of the package every time (the most recent version
    available on CRAN at that date).
