Description: Make R scripts reproducible, by ensuring that
    every time a given script is run, the same version of the used packages are
    loaded (instead of whichever version the user running the script happens to
    have installed). This is achieved by using the command
    groundhog.library() instead of the base command library(), and including a
    date in the call. The date is used to call on the same version of the
    package every time (the most recent version available at that date).
    Load packages  from CRAN, GitHub, or Gitlab.	
	=======================================
	Note: groundhog relied on Microsoft's MRAN archive which is being discontinued.
	This version of groundhog is transitioning away from MRAN, relying on it only for 
	dates prior to Jan 31, 2023. A future release of groundhog, v2.3.0, 
	expected by May 2023, will discontinue relying on MRAN entirely.
