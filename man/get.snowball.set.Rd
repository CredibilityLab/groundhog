\title{Generates dataframe with all dependencies needed to install multiple packages, in the order they will be loaded}
\usage{
get.snowball.set(pkgs, date, include.suggests = FALSE, force.install = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pkgs}{character vector, names of target packages to load (and install if needed)}

\item{date}{character string  (yyyy-mm-dd), or date value, with the date which determines the
version of the packages, and all dependencies, to be loaded (and installed if needed).}

\item{include.suggests}{logical, defaults to \code{FALSE}. When set to \code{TRUE}, includes
dependencies classified in the DESCRIPTION file as \code{suggested}.}

\item{force.install}{logical, defaults to \code{FALSE}. When set to \code{TRUE}, the column \code{installed}
in the generated snowball is set FALSE for all packages, causing them to be installed even if already installed.}
}
\value{
a dataframe with all packages that need to be installed, their version , whether they are installed, where
to obtain them if not locally available (CRAN vs MRAN), which date to use for MRAN,
