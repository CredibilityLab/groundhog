\title{Restore default library of packages, undoing all changes made by groundhog}
\usage{
restore.library(days)
}
\arguments{
\item{days}{an optional numeric argument used to choose among alternative restore points.
When \code{days} is set, groundhog restores the personal library to the  most recent restore point, that
is at least \code{days} days ago. If it is not set it restores to the most recent restore point.
For example, if there are two restore points: one from today, and one from 7 days ago,
running \code{restore.library()} would restore to the former, setting \code{days=3} would restore to the latter,
and setting \code{days=8} would result in an error. \code{days = -1} restores to the oldest restore point available.}
}
\description{
Instantaneously reverse changes made by groundhog to the default personal
library where R packages are usually installed into.
If you are just trying groundhog out for the first time,
or you generally rely on base R's \code{library()} and want to use \code{groundhog.library()} for a specific
one time purpose then you may want to run \code{restore.library()}
when you are done with your one-time use of groundhog; you will undo any and all
changes made by \code{groundhog}. Restoring a library takes less than a second even if the library
has 100s of packages.
}
\details{
When groundhog installs a package, it installs it into groundhog's library
(location of that library is obtainable with \code{\link[=get.groundhog.folder]{get.groundhog.folder()}}).
Groundhog then immediately moves the installed package(s) (and their dependencies)
to the default personal library (location of that library obtainable with: \code{.libPaths()[1]}).
Altering the packages in the local folder is necessary for groundhog to work properly for two main reasons. First,
R Studio often loads packages from that library before users run the code in a script, creating
version conflicts that cannot be avoided when attempting to load other versions of those
packages with \code{groundhog}. Second, R scripts often run processes in independent R sessions, for
example when doing parallel processing. Those background processes will also look for
packages in the default personal folder. Because the personal library can only hold
one version of a given package, before moving new packages in, groundhog moves
any existing other versions of those packages out, to another directory (a local archive).
Those files are not deleted, just moved, making it easy and fast to recover.
When the first change in the personal folder is made on a given calendar date,
groundhog makes a list of all packages available in the personal folder before such change (saving
a copy of the results from \code{installed.packages(.libPaths()[1])}), this saved file is referred to as a
a 'restore point'. With \code{restore.library()} groundhog looks up a restore point, obtain the set of packages
that used to be installed, and removes any packages \emph{installed by groundhog} which are in the personal library
but were not in that restore point; similarly, it moves back to the local library any packages \emph{removed by groundhog}
that were in the restore point but are not currently there. This process is essentially instantaneous even for 100+ packages.
Note that there is only one restore point per calendar date, so one effectively restores
the personal library to how it was before \emph{any} changes were made to it that day with groundhog.
Restore points are saved permanently and can be restored at any point.
The set of restore points available is stored in the hidden dataframe \code{.available.restore.points}.
To choose among them use the \code{days} argument in \code{restore.library}. The default is to restore
based on the most recent restore point, so if a user installs groundhog, tests it, and wants to
undo all changes made by groundhog, the default behavior will achieve this goal.
