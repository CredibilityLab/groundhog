\description{
groundhog often moves packages between the groundhog library and the default personal library.
This is done by renaming the package folder, which is a nearly instantaneous process even for
100+ packages. This renaming method, however, is sometimes unavailable for some configurations
(e.g., when the groundhog and personal folders are on different drives/volumes, say external vs internal hard drives). When
groundhog determines this is the case, a cookie file tells groundhog to rely on the slower methods of
moving the packages between libraries by copying-and-deleting. To over-rule this determination
run \code{try.renaming.method.again()} and the next groundhog.library() call will again attempt it. If it fails again
the cookie file will be created anew, returning to copying-and-deleting.
