#'  Generates dataframe with all dependencies needed to install a package, in the order they will be loaded
#'
#'@param pkg character string, name of target package to load (and install if needed), 
#'@param date character string  (yyyy-mm-dd), or date value, with the date which determines the 
#'version of the package, and all dependencies, to be loaded (and installed if needed).
#'@param include.suggests logical, defaults to `FALSE`. When set to `TRUE`, includes
#'   dependencies classified in the DESCRIPTION file as `suggested`.
#'@param force.source logical (defaults to `FALSE`). When set to `TRUE`, will not attempt 
#'   installing binary from CRAN or MRAN and instead download source file and install it.
#'@return a dataframe with all packages that need to be installed, their version , whether they are installed, where 
#'to obtain them if not locally available (CRAN vs MRAN), which date to use for MRAN, 
#'installation time from source (in seconds), and local path for storage
