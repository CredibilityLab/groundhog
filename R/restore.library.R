#' Restore version of packages in personal library replaced by groundhog.
#'
#' When groundhog installs a package, it saves two copies of it.
#' One goes on the stable groundhog library (to find its location: `get.groundhog.folder()`)
#' the other goes to the default personal library (to find its location: `.libPaths()[1]`.
#' Because the personal library can only hold one version of a package, groundhog replaces 
#' existing versions of packages that already exist in the personal library (if any), but 
#' it makes a copy of those versions in groundhog's stable library. You can restore your 
#' personal non-groundhog library to how it was on a previous date (e.g., prior to 
#' testing groundhog for the first time). Run `restore.library()` and the backup
#' copy of the original package version will be copied to the personal library. 
#' 
#'@param days an optional numeric argument used to choose among alternative restore points.
#'When set, groundhog restores the personal library to the  most recent restore point, that is at least `days` days ago.
#'For example, if `days=5`, the library is restored to the most recent restore point more than 5 days ago.
#'`restore.library()` by default restores the oldest restore point recorded, while `restore.library(0)` will 
#'restore the most recent (e.g., earlier today if any changes have been made with groundhog today).
