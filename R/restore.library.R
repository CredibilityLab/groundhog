#' Restore default library of packages, undoing all changes made by groundhog
#'
#' In a few seconds reverse changes made by groundhog to the default personal 
#' library (where R packages are usually installed into with `installed.packages()`).  
#' If you are just trying groundhog out for the first time,
#' or you generally rely on base R's `library()` and want to use `groundhog.library()` sporadically
#' then you may want to run `restore.library()` when you are done with your one-time use of groundhog.
#' This will undo any and all changes made by `groundhog` to that library. 
#' In most circumstances, restoring a library takes a few seconds, even if the library 
#' has had 100s of package modifications. 
#'   
#'@param days an optional numeric argument used to choose among alternative restore points.
#' When `days` is set, groundhog restores the personal library to the  most recent restore point that 
#' is at least `days` days old. If `dais` is not set, groundhog restores to the most recent restore point overall. 
#' For example, if there are two restore points: one from today, and one from 7 days ago,
#' running `restore.library()` would restore to the former, setting `days=3` would restore to the latter, 
#' and setting `days=8` would result in an error. `days = -1` restores to the oldest restore point available.

#' @details 
#'When groundhog installs a package, it installs it into groundhog's library 
#' (location of that library is obtainable with [get.groundhog.folder()]).
#'Groundhog then immediately moves the installed package(s) (and their dependencies) 
#'to the default personal library (location of that library obtainable with: `.libPaths()[1]`). 
#'Altering the packages in the local folder is necessary for groundhog to work properly for two main reasons. First,
#'R Studio often loads packages from that library before users run the code in a script, creating
#'version conflicts that cannot be avoided when attempting to load other versions of those
#'packages with `groundhog`. Second, R scripts often run processes in independent R sessions, for 
#'example when doing parallel processing. Those background processes will also look for 
#'packages in the default personal folder. Because the personal library can only hold 
#'one version of a given package, before moving new packages in, groundhog moves 
#'any existing other versions of those packages out, to another directory (a local archive).
#'Those files are not deleted, just moved, making it easy and fast to recover.
#'When the first change in the personal folder is made on a given calendar date, 
#'groundhog makes a list of all packages available in the personal folder before such change (saving
#'a copy of the results from `installed.packages(.libPaths()[1])`), this saved file is referred to as a 
#'a 'restore point'. With `restore.library()` groundhog looks up a restore point, obtain the set of packages
#'that used to be installed, and removes any packages *installed by groundhog* which are in the personal library
#'but were not in that restore point; similarly, it moves back to the local library any packages *removed by groundhog*
#'that were in the restore point but are not currently there. This process take a few seconds even for 100+ packages.
#'Note that there is only one restore point per calendar date, so one effectively restores
#'the personal library to how it was before *any* changes were made to it that day with groundhog. 
#'Restore points are saved permanently and can be restored at any point. 
#'The set of restore points available is stored in the hidden dataframe `.available.restore.points`. 
#'To choose among them use the `days` argument in `restore.library`. The default is to restore 
#'based on the most recent restore point, so if a user installs groundhog, tests it, and wants to 
#'undo all changes made by groundhog, the default behavior will achieve this goal.
#'Note: restoring can take a few minutes if the groundhog folder is on a different
#'drive from the default personal R library (e.g., two different hard drives) or if it is in Dropbox.
