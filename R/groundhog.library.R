#' Load CRAN, GitHub & Gitlab packages, and their dependencies, as current on given date 
#' 
#' Groundhog maintains a separate local package library where it stores 
#' version-controlled packages, with multiple versions of the same package saved side-by-side. 
#' The `date` argument in the `groundhog.library()` function determines
#' the version of the package that is loaded (the most recently published version on CRAN on that date).
#' If that version of the package is not available in the local `groundhog` library, 
#' it is automatically installed. `groundhog.library()` thus substitutes both `library()` 
#' and `install.packages()`. No changes to how R manages packages are made (e.g., no change to 
#' .libPaths(), to .Rprofile, or to R Studio global settings). 
#' Therefore, to discontinue relying on `groundhog` for package management, all you do is go back to 
#' executing the `install.packages()` and `library()` functions, instead of the `groundhog.library()` function.
#'  
#'@param pkg character string or vector with name of target package(s). Single package names need not be in quotes.
#'@param date character string  (yyyy-mm-dd), or date value, with the date which determines the 
#'version of the package, and all dependencies, to be loaded (and installed if needed). The most recent
#'date accepted is 2 days prior to when the code is executed.
#'@param quiet.install logical, defaults to `TRUE`. When set to `FALSE`, displays
#'  output generated by `install.packages()` when installing from source
#'@param include.suggests logical, defaults to `FALSE`. When set to `TRUE`, installs/
#'  loads dependencies classified in the DESCRIPTION file as `suggested`.
#'@param ignore.deps an optional character vector containing dependencies which 
#'   may be already loaded in the R session and even if the loaded version does not match
#'   the version implied by the entered date, groundhog.library() will proceed and ignore 
#'   this conflict. If one version of a package is loaded, and a different is needed for
#'   groundhog, the default behavior is to stop the request and ask the user to restart
#'   the R session to unload all packages. This will bypass that requirement.
#'@param force.source logical (defaults to `FALSE`). When set to `TRUE`, will not attempt 
#'   installing binary from CRAN or MRAN and instead download source file and install it.
#'@param force.install logical (defaults to `FALSE`). When set to `TRUE`, will delete  
#'   existing package files in groundhog folder, and install anew.
#'@param tolerate.R.version optional character string containing an R version which 
#' `groundhog.library()` will not throw an error for using, even if the date entered 
#' corresponds to a more recent major R release.  
#'@return a character vector containing all active packages for the session,
#'   with their version number, under the format `pkg_vrs`.
