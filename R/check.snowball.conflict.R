# Check snowball conflict

#1  short name for package being installed/loaded
#2  Ignore conflicts 
#3  Active packages
#4  Conflict 1: force Install (is any package that needs to be *installed*  loaded)
#5  Conflict 2: Same remote, different date
#6  Obtain vector with all conflicting packages
#7  Conflict 3 - different version
#8  Conflict 4 - pkg 1 on CRAN, pkg 2 is remotes, so even same date creates conflict
#9  Conflict 5 - pkg 1 on Remote, pkg 2 is CRAN, so even same date creates conflict
#10 Conflict 6 - Typical conflict: both packages are in CRAN, one was loaded before groundhog tried
